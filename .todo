Performance Issues and Bugs: 
  ☐ add a substitute after the removal of lastfm apis (probably also the the same api as the streaming service) @low
  ☐ rewrite storage scanning and caching to append placeholders before it reads the track's metadata (like podcasts) @low

Testing:

Features:
  ☐ adding collection podcasts to search overlay whenever it occurs @high 

  ☐ a load more button to load more podcast episodes @high 

  ☐ refreshing collection podcasts @high 

  ☐ research feed suggestions & an api to get more accurate info about artist releases @low 
    (probably the same api as the streaming service)
  
  ☐ research adding a streaming service support like (Spotify or Deezer or etc) @low

  ☐ research statistics to show in the feed page @low

  ☐ using the feed page: add downloading feature and make it flexible, so that it can download podcasts or tracks alike @low

UI/UX:
  ☐ sketch the feed page @low
  ☐ sketch the way that a streaming service will fit in Dawayer UI @low 

CI/CD:
  ☐ release a PWA [ needs a lot of work to replace the incompatible dependencies (fs and music-metadata) ]

  ☐ release a Windows build after testing @help-needed
    ☐ we might be able to test platform sensitive features using wine @low 

  ☐ release a macOS build after testing @help-needed
