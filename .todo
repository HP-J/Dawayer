Performance Issues and Bugs: 
  ☐ add a substitute after the removal of lastfm apis (probably also the the same api as the streaming service)
  ☐ rewrite storage scanning and caching to append placeholders before it reads the track's metadata (like podcasts)

  ☐ a way for podcasts to get seek-time and duration from the playback.js
  ☐ saved queues if they have any remote urls it won't save/load the artist or the title

Testing:
  ☐ test loading saved queue on app start
  ☐ test opening dawayer with a file and remote urls in args

  ☐ calling another queuing process while a queuing process is already taking place might cause Dawayer to break

Features:
  ☐ a load more button to load more podcast episodes

  ☐ cache and load podcasts
  ☐ search functions in the collection overlay and its items have add button

  ☐ research feed suggestions & an api to get more accurate info about artist releases
    (probably the same api as the streaming service)
  
  ☐ research adding a streaming service support like (Spotify or Deezer or etc)

  ☐ research statistics to show in the feed page

  ☐ using the feed page: add downloading feature and make it flexible, so that it can download podcasts or tracks alike

UI/UX:
  ☐ sketch the feed page
  ☐ sketch the way that a streaming service will fit in Dawayer UI

CI/CD:
  ☐ release a PWA (needs a lot of work to replace the incompatible dependencies from Dawayer)

  ☐ release a Windows build after testing @help-needed
  ☐ release a macOS build after testing @help-needed
