Performance Issues and Bugs: 
  ☐ add a substitute after the removal of lastfm apis (probably also the the same api as the streaming service)
  ☐ rewrite storage scanning and caching to append placeholders before it reads the track's metadata (like podcasts)

Testing:
  ☐ test loading saved queue on app start
  ☐ test opening dawayer with a file and remote urls in args

Features:
  ☐ search functions in the collection overlay and its items have add button

  ☐ cache and load podcasts
  ☐ a load more button to load more podcast episodes

  ☐ research feed suggestions & an api to get more accurate info about artist releases
    (probably the same api as the streaming service)
  
  ☐ research adding a streaming service support like (Spotify or Deezer or etc)

  ☐ research statistics to show in the feed page

  ☐ using the feed page: add downloading feature and make it flexible, so that it can download podcasts or tracks alike

UI/UX:
  ☐ sketch the feed page
  ☐ sketch the way that a streaming service will fit in Dawayer UI

CI/CD:
  ☐ release a PWA [ needs a lot of work to replace the incompatible dependencies (fs and music-metadata) ]

  ☐ release a Windows build after testing @help-needed?
    ☐ we might be able to test platform sensitive features using wine

  ☐ release a macOS build after testing @help-needed
