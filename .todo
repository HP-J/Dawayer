Performance Issues and Bugs: 
  ☐ add a substitute after the removal of lastfm apis (probably also the the same api as the streaming service)
  ☐ rewrite storage scanning and caching to append placeholders before it reads the track's metadata (like podcasts)

  ☐ does queue have context menus? if yes they don't have contextHover styles yet.

Testing:

Features:
  ☐ a load more button to load more podcast episodes
  ☐ cache and load podcasts

  ☐ redesign podcast element to look better after removing the artist label
  ☐ redesign podcast element to auto height with the height of the title
  
  ☐ redesign podcast overlay to look better after removing the artist label
  ☐ redesign podcast overlay to show episodes summary

  ☐ research feed suggestions & an api to get more accurate info about artist releases
    (probably the same api as the streaming service)
  
  ☐ research adding a streaming service support like (Spotify or Deezer or etc)

  ☐ research statistics to show in the feed page

  ☐ using the feed page: add downloading feature and make it flexible, so that it can download podcasts or tracks alike

UI/UX:
  ☐ sketch the feed page

CI/CD:
  ☐ release a Windows build after testing @help-needed
  ☐ release a macOS build after testing @help-needed
