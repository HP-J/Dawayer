Performance Issues and Bugs: 
  ☐ add a substitute after the removal of lastfm apis

Testing:

Features:
  ☐ research feed & an api to get more accurate info about artist releases
    (probably limited the same api as the streaming service without the streaming part)
  
  ☐ research adding a streaming service support like (Spotify or Deezer or etc)
  ☐ using the feed page: add downloading feature and make it flexible, so that it can download podcasts or tracks alike

UI/UX:
  ☐ seek bar loading animation when track or podcast is loading/buffering
  
  ☐ dark mode
  ☐ light mode

CI/CD:
  ☐ release a Windows build after testing @help-needed
  ☐ release a macOS build after testing @help-needed
